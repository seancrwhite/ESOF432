Factory Pattern:

The factory pattern is a creational design pattern that aims to instantiate an interface for classes while defering concrete instantiation to subclasses. This allows individual applications to define their own objects compliant with a standardized architecture. It works by defining an object-creating class with seperately defined methods for creating these objects. Subclasses can override these methods to change the specifics of the target object, as such the factory pattern relies heavily on inheritance.
